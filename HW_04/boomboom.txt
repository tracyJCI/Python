A told B, and B told C, "I'll meet you at the top of the coconut tree."
"Wheee!" said D to E F G, "I'll beat you to the top of the coconut tree."
Chicka chicka boom boom! Will there be enough room? Here comes H up the coconut tree,

Chicka chicka boom boom! Will there be enough room? Look who's coming! L M N O P!

The whole alphabet up the - Oh, no! Chicka chicka... BOOM! BOOM!
Skit skat skoodle doot. Flip flop flee. Everybody running to the coconut tree.
Mamas and papas and uncles and aunts hug their little dears, then dust their pants.
"Help us up," cried A B C.
Next from the pileup skinned-knee D and stubbed-toe E and patched-up F. Then comes G all out of breath.
H is tangled up with I. J and K are about to cry. L is knotted like a tie.
M is looped. N is stopped. O is twisted alley-oop. Skit skat skoodle doot. Flip flop flee.
Look who's coming! It's black-eyed P, Q R S, and loose-tooth T. Then U V W wiggle-jiggle free.
Last to come X Y Z. And the sun goes down on the coconut tree...
But - chicka chicka boom boom! Look, there's a full moon.
