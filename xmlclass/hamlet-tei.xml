                    Crowdfunding</funder>
                <funder>The second phase of the Bodleian First Folio project was made possible by a
                    lead gift from Dr Geoffrey Eibl-Kaye and generous support from the Sallie
                    Dickson Memorial Fund/Dallas Shakespeare Club Fund, Mr James Barber, and a
                    private individual. The Bodleian Libraries are very grateful for this additional
                    support, which brings new features to the digitized First Folio, enabling more
                    efficient and intuitive use for all with an interest in Shakespeare, early
                    modern drama, theatre and book history.</funder>

                            <decoNote>With an engraved title-page portrait of the author signed:
                                "Martin- Droeshout: sculpsit¬∑ London.". The plate exists in 2
                                states: 1. The earlier state has lighter shading generall ; 2. Later
                                state has heavier shading, especially around the collar, and minor
                                differences particularly with the jawline and moustache. The vast
                                majority of surviving copies have the plate in the second state
                                which has led some scholars to conclude that the earlier state was a
                                proof. The portrait in this copy is the second state. </decoNote>
